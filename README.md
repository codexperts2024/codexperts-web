## Agile Process

This project follows a **5-phase Agile sprint cycle** across 6 weekly sprints, with the full team meeting every Saturday at 7:30 PM via Google Meet. Each phase reflects real-world software team practices.

```
Planning → Design → Development → Testing → Review & Release
   ↑                                               │
   └───────────────── next sprint ◀────────────────┘
```

---

### 1. Planning

Each sprint begins by defining goals, refining the backlog, and assigning GitHub Issues to team members.

- **Week 1** — Defined 6-week roadmap and MVP scope · Created GitHub Issues · Assigned tasks across FE/BE · Set up GitHub Projects Kanban board

---

### 2. Design

Covers UI/UX wireframes, system architecture decisions, DB schema design, and API contract definition — not just visual design, but how the entire system is structured.

- **Week 1** — Finalized sitemap and page visibility rules · Produced Figma wireframes for all 8 pages · Finalized DB schema (profiles, problems, submissions, sessions, attendances, announcements) · Defined navbar structure and social link config

---

### 3. Development

Team members work on feature branches tied to their assigned issues. No direct commits to `develop` or `main`.

- **Week 1** — Next.js + Tailwind project setup · Supabase project created + Google OAuth configured · RLS policies drafted · Vercel + Railway pipelines connected · Placeholder pages scaffolded for all routes

---

### 4. Testing

Manual QA on Vercel preview deployments. Each PR is reviewed by at least one team member before merging to `develop`.

- **Week 1** — Google login → pending user flow tested end-to-end · Vercel preview deploy verified · Environment variable setup confirmed across team

---

### 5. Review & Release

Sprint retrospective held at each Saturday meeting. `develop` is merged to `main` when the sprint goals are met and testing passes.

- **Week 1** — Sprint retrospective completed · Foundation merged to `develop` · Preview URL shared with team

---

### GitHub Projects — Kanban Board

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Backlog` | Unscheduled items |
| `Ready` | Committed for current sprint |
| `In Progress` | Actively being developed |
| `In Review` | PR open, awaiting review |
| `Done` | Merged and deployed |

### Issue & PR Convention
- **Issue title format:** `[Type] Short description`
  - Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `chore`
- **PR title format:** mirrors the linked issue
- All PRs require at least **1 reviewer approval** before merge
- PRs are linked to their corresponding issue

### Branch Strategy
```
main
└── develop
    ├── feature/auth-google-login
    ├── feature/admin-dashboard
    ├── fix/member-approval-flow
    └── docs/update-readme
```

| Branch | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `main` | Production-ready code only |
| `develop` | Integration branch — all features merge here first |
| `feature/*` | Individual feature or fix branches |

> **Rule:** Never commit directly to `main`. All changes go through `develop` via reviewed PRs.

---

## Key Features

### 1. Coding Problems & Submission
- Weekly problems posted by executives
- Monaco Editor (VSCode-style) for writing code in-browser
- Piston API for code execution — supports Python, Java, C++, and more
- Submissions saved and visible to all members

### 2. QR Attendance Check
- Admin starts a session before each meeting — generates a unique token
- Members scan the QR code to check in automatically
- Session expires after a set time or when admin closes it
- Duplicate check-in prevention built in

### 3. Activity Heatmap
- GitHub-style contribution graph per member profile
- Combines submission history and attendance records
- More activity = deeper color

### 4. Member Directory
- Profile cards: photo, name, school, LinkedIn, GitHub
- Filter by cohort (class year)

---

## System Architecture

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

```
Public (Unauthenticated)
  └── Member (Approved)
        └── Executive
              └── Admin
```

| Role | Access Level |
|------|-------------|
| **Public** | Landing page, public announcements |
| **Member** | Club dashboard, member directory, problem submissions |
| **Executive** | Post problems, manage sessions |
| **Admin** | User approval, role management, full access |

**Onboarding Flow:**
```
Google Sign-In → pending status → Admin approval → member role assigned
```

### Backend Architecture

```
Frontend (Next.js — Vercel)
│
├── Supabase
│   ├── Auth (Google OAuth only)
│   └── PostgreSQL
│       ├── profiles       → id, name, email, role (pending|member|executive|admin),
│       │                     school, linkedin, github, avatar_url
│       ├── problems       → id, title, description, file_url, created_at
│       ├── submissions    → profile_id, problem_id, code, language, ai_feedback
│       ├── sessions       → token, expires_time, is_active (QR attendance sessions)
│       ├── attendances    → profile_id, session_id, checked_at
│       └── announcements  → author_id, title, content, created_at
│
└── FastAPI (Railway)
    ├── /execute           → proxy to Piston API (code execution)
    └── /attendance/verify → QR token validation logic
```

---

## Deployment

| Layer | Platform | Domain |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Frontend | Vercel | codexperts.ca |
| Backend | Railway | auto-assigned Railway URL |
| Database & Auth | Supabase | managed |

> Domain: Starting with Vercel free subdomain. Will migrate to `codexperts.ca` upon MVP completion.
